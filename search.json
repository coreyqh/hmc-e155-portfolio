    "text": "Corey Hickson is a class of 2026 Engineering Major at Harvey Mudd College with background in design verification and digital design. As a VLSI research fellow with the Clay-Wolkin Fellowship at Harvey Mudd, he has conducted core level functional testing and coverage collection of a RISC-V processor core. While interning at Skyworks Solutions in the summer of 2025, he conducted whole core level formal verification of a different RISC-V processor core. Corey looks forward to the 2025-26 HRL Laboratories engineering clinic project, where he and his team will work towards producing a C program to emulate a mixed analog-digital quantum qubit control board. After graduation, he will return to Skyworks as a Design Verification Engineer 1 to continue his work in formal verification from the past summer."

    "text": "In the Lab\nWhile there were no technical deliverables for this week, I still spent a few hours in the lab soldering all components and connectors to the PCB motherboard. I am not the most skilled at soldering, and I did not have previous experience with surface mounted soldering so this was a bit of a challenge. After much slouching, a considerable amount of solder wick, and a few backwards idodes, I have now finished this task and can move onto lab 1!"

My primary goal is to expand my scope as an electrical engineer beyone ASIC RTL and DV, and into the realm of embedded systems. My secondary goal is to have fun with this class and enjoy my final year at Mudd. I really enjoyed E80 and the E85 microprocessor based labs, so I know that I will enjoy this course now that I have the chance to take it."
