Corey Hickson is a class of 2026 Engineering Major at Harvey Mudd College with background in design
verification and digital design. As a VLSI research fellow with the Clay-Wolkin Fellowship at
Harvey Mudd, he has conducted core level functional testing and coverage collection of a RISC-V
processor core. While interning at Skyworks Solutions in the summer of 2025, he conducted whole core
level formal verification of a different RISC-V processor core. Corey looks forward to the 2025-26 
HRL Laboratories engineering clinic project, where he and his team will work towards producing a C
program to emulate a mixed analog-digital quantum qubit control board. After graduation, he will
return to Skyworks as a Design Verification Engineer 1 to continue his work in formal verification from
the past summer.
