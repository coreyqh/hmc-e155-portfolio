## Lab 6: The Internet of Things and Serial Peripheral Interface

### Introduction
This report outlines the design of an Internet of Things based temperature sensor and webpage

### Design Methodology
To record temperatures to display on the device's webpage, I used a SPI temperature sensor which is written to for configuration and read from to get the temperature in fixed point format.
The DS1722 temperature sensor's data sheet can be found [here](https://hmc-e155.github.io/assets/doc/ds1722.pdf)

For this, I had to write a custom SPI library in C to configure the SPI registers on the MCU and drive data out and read data back. 

### Webpage Design
I designed the webpage to have button inputs to configure the number of bits of resolution via an HTTP request in the same way that the starter code turns a LED on and off.

### Technical Documentation
The C source code for this lab can by found on my [github page](https://www.github.com/coreyqh/hmc-e155-lab6)

#### SPI Verification
To verify SPI transactions occured properl, I used a logic analyzer to show an SPI read and write between the MCU and temperature sensor

### Results and discussion
My design successfully displayed the temperature data from a DS1722 temperature sensor on a webpage with button selected 8 to 12 bit resolution.

This lab took me 10 hours
